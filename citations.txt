Kelvin - We mainly relied on what we learned in class, and, whenever I couldn't remember how to use 
		 a particular function (for example the srand() one, I would use Ctrl + F in the classNotes.cpp 
		 file to be reminded how).

	   - I also used some knowledge I have from programming that involves including vectors of classes
	     and chained methods to accomplish tasks like getting an attack's damage after I call a method
		 that returns a particular attack from a vector of Attacks kept within an Attacks class (a 
		 class that can print many attacks in a formatted manner and has other useful functions we made 
		 to ease our game's creation and implementation - like assigning an attack in numerous ways 
		 through distinct method overloads).
		 I used google for a lot of the stuff i didnt know like the time delay
